- Fix the linear problem. (eta=0 in system matrix, matrix re-built at every stage?) -HBB
- Define different stable release versions using cvs tag <releasename>. I have defined a tag "beta" Feb 8, 2011, which should be a stable version. (APEK)
- It appears that HBB? only added breaking model terms to the 1D setup with Nx>1 and Ny=1. Should be applied to all terms in the setup. (APEK)
