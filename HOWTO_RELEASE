This document describes how to make a release version of OceanWave3D.

Source: https://ariejan.net/2006/11/21/svn-how-to-release-software-properly/

FAQ:

1) Make a new tag (new release version)
Release versions are always created from current trunk.

Example: (change user in path)
svn copy svn://apek@svn.gbar.dtu.dk/apek/OceanWave3D/trunk svn://apek@svn.gbar.dtu.dk/apek/OceanWave3D/tags/Release-0.99.0 -m "creating first release tag"

Remark: Do a SVN UPDATE in the main directory or tag directory to get the files in the local version. It is not needed though. Never commit changes to a release version(!!!)

2) How to check out a release version
A checkout of a release version is done using the shell scriptfile 
  ./checkoutrelease.sh

This shell script contains the following lines of code and requires modification of the variables to be accurate.

#!/bin/sh
PRODUCT="OceanWave3D"
USER=apek
NUM=0.99.0
DIR="$PRODUCT"
svn export svn://$USER@svn.gbar.dtu.dk/$USER/OceanWave3D/tags/Release-$NUM
tar czf $PRODUCT-$NUM.tar.gz $DIR
